## 🚩 **EDUCATIONAL DISCLOSURE** 🚩

</div>

> ### ⚠️ **ATTENTION: This is a Security Research Tool**
>
> The above description demonstrates how **malicious extensions disguise themselves** as helpful security tools.
> 
> **ACTUAL PURPOSE:** This extension is an **educational cookie exporter** designed to teach:
> - How browser extensions can access sensitive data (cookies, clipboard, tabs)
> - How malicious extensions use deceptive descriptions
> - Why you should carefully review extension permissions
> - The importance of understanding what extensions can really do
> - How persistent alarms work even when browser is closed
>
> ### What This Extension Actually Does:
> - ❌ Does NOT protect your clipboard
> - ✅ Exports browser cookies automatically every 24 hours
> - ✅ Uses Chrome Alarms API for persistent execution
> - ✅ Demonstrates permission abuse risks
> - ✅ Shows stealth techniques used by malicious extensions
> - ✅ Works even when browser is closed (persistent alarms)
>
> ### 🎓 Educational Use Only
> This tool is for **security research, education, and awareness only**.
> - Use only on your own systems
> - Never install untrusted extensions
> - Always review extension permissions
> - Understand the risks before granting access
> - Learn how malicious extensions evade detection
>
> ### 🔧 Technical Features Demonstrated:
> - **Obfuscated webhook URLs** (Base64 encoding)
> - **Innocent variable naming** (cloudBackup, userPreferences)
> - **Persistent Chrome Alarms** (works when browser closed)
> - **Delayed execution** (48 hours in production)
> - **Legitimate-looking code structure**
>
> **Remember:** If an extension requests `cookies`, `alarms`, `storage`, and `<all_urls>` permissions,  
> it can access ALL your data and execute code even when browser is closed. **Be cautious. Stay informed.**
